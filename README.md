This study introduces a formal model aimed at developing algorithms for the aggregation of a collection of texts into a single cohesive text. The common thread among all agents involved is a shared field of interest, a unified purpose, and a text structure with the primary objective of finding a solution (i.e., text) that minimizes the Kemeny distance from all other individual texts. Notably, the Kemeny distance is recognized as NP-hard, which introduces a substantial computational challenge. In response to this complexity, we present several heuristic approaches to effectively tackle the optimization problem and obtain meaningful solutions. Our approach leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly focusing on Word2Vec, in conjunction with insights from the field of social choice theory.
